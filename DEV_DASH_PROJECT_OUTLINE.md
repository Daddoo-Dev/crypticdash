# Dev Dash - Developer Dashboard
## Project Overview
A distributed project management application that connects to GitHub repositories, creates/updates markdown project files, and provides a unified dashboard for tracking development progress across multiple projects.

## Core Concept
- **Distributed Management**: Each repository maintains its own project state in markdown files
- **Unified Dashboard**: Single app view of all projects and todos across repositories
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit/push of project updates to respective repositories
- **Template System**: Predefined project templates for common development workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
- **Dashboard View**: Project tiles showing progress and pending todos
- **Project Detail View**: Individual project management interface
- **Settings**: GitHub authentication and repository selection
- **Template Management**: Custom project template creation/editing

### Backend Services
- **GitHub API Integration**: Repository access and file operations
- **Markdown Parser**: Todo extraction and formatting
- **Git Operations**: Commit, push, and conflict resolution
- **Authentication Service**: GitHub OAuth and token management

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates with GitHub
2. App scans selected repositories for project markdown files
3. Parses markdown files to extract todos and progress
4. Displays aggregated data in dashboard
5. User updates trigger markdown file modifications
6. Changes are committed and pushed to respective repositories

## Core Features

### 1. GitHub Integration
- OAuth authentication
- Repository selection and management
- File read/write permissions
- Webhook support for real-time updates

### 2. Project Templates
- **Web App Template**: Planning, design, development, testing, deployment
- **Mobile App Template**: UI/UX, development, testing, app store submission
- **API Template**: Design, development, documentation, testing
- **Custom Templates**: User-defined project workflows

### 3. Markdown File Structure
```markdown
# Project Name
## Overview
Brief project description

## Progress: 45% Complete

## Todo List
- [x] Project setup and planning
- [x] Basic architecture design
- [ ] Core functionality implementation
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployment

## Notes
Additional project information and updates
```

### 4. Dashboard Features
- Project progress visualization
- Todo aggregation across all projects
- Priority-based sorting
- Search and filtering
- Progress statistics and trends

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub API Usage
- **Contents API**: Read/write markdown files
- **Repositories API**: List user repositories
- **Authentication**: Personal access tokens or OAuth
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle API quotas gracefully

### Markdown Processing
- **Todo Extraction**: Parse checkbox syntax `- [ ]` and `- [x]`
- **Progress Calculation**: Percentage based on completed vs total todos
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits intelligently

### Git Operations
- **Commit Strategy**: Meaningful commit messages for project updates
- **Branch Management**: Optional feature branch creation
- **Conflict Handling**: User notification and resolution options

## User Experience

### Onboarding
1. GitHub authentication
2. Repository selection
3. Template selection for existing projects
4. Initial project file creation

### Daily Usage
1. Open dashboard to see all project statuses
2. Click project tile to view details
3. Mark todos as complete
4. Add new todos or notes
5. Changes automatically sync to repositories

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- No project data stored on external servers
- All data remains in user's GitHub repositories
- Authentication tokens stored locally and securely
- Optional data encryption for sensitive projects

### Permissions
- Read-only access to public repositories
- Read/write access to user's own repositories
- Organization repository access (with proper permissions)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- GitHub authentication
- Basic repository scanning
- Markdown file creation/editing
- Simple dashboard display

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Project templates
- Progress tracking
- Git operations
- Conflict resolution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Real-time updates via webhooks
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile app development

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale
- Performance optimization
- Advanced conflict resolution
- Template marketplace
- API for third-party integrations

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile and desktop app
- **Material 3**: Modern UI design system
- **State Management**: Provider or Riverpod
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences or Hive

### Backend (if needed)
- **Node.js/Express**: API server (optional)
- **GitHub API**: Repository and file operations
- **Markdown Processing**: Remark or similar library

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Flutter testing framework
- **Documentation**: Markdown with GitHub Pages

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Git Conflicts**: Implement smart conflict detection and resolution
- **API Limits**: Cache data and implement rate limiting
- **File Corruption**: Backup and validation before commits
- **Authentication**: Secure token storage and refresh handling

### Business Risks
- **GitHub Policy Changes**: Monitor API updates and adapt
- **Competition**: Focus on unique distributed approach
- **User Adoption**: Provide clear value proposition and ease of use

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Projects tracked per user
- Repository connections per user
- Update frequency

### Technical Performance
- API response times
- Git operation success rates
- Conflict resolution efficiency
- App performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Smart todo recommendations
- **Time Tracking**: Integration with time management tools
- **Dependency Management**: Project interdependency tracking
- **Automated Workflows**: CI/CD integration

### Platform Expansion
- **GitLab Integration**: Support for alternative Git platforms
- **Bitbucket Support**: Atlassian ecosystem integration
- **Self-Hosted Git**: Support for private Git servers
- **Desktop App**: Native desktop application

## Conclusion
Dev Dash addresses a real need in the developer community by providing a unified view of distributed projects while maintaining the decentralized nature of Git-based development. The technical challenges are manageable, and the unique approach sets it apart from existing solutions.

The key to success will be creating an intuitive user experience that makes distributed project management feel seamless and natural, while providing robust conflict resolution and error handling for the complex Git operations involved.
